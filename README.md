# 🔍 ChainWatch AI

ChainWatch AI is an AI-powered transaction tracing and compliance agent built with the JuliaOS framework. It reconstructs the full path of onchain transactions across Solana, flags suspicious activity (mixers, bridges, looping patterns), and generates LLM-driven compliance insights.

## 🧠 Powered by JuliaOS
- `agent.useLLM()` for analyzing transaction behavior
- Optional swarm coordination for complex paths
- Solana onchain query support
